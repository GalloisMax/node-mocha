# Test your Nodejs code with mocha

## About TDD

Test Driven Development is a development philosophy.
This is about reproducing three steps until your code works and do what you want it to do (the hard stuff about coding).

1. Write a test first: you know what your code should do, this test must fail first
2. Write the simplest solution to succeed the test
3. Refactor your code, make it worthy and beautiful

## Instructions

1. First look this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLTRHc5dk6s)

Focus on the command lines. You will learn how to install mocha and how to use it with a very simple example.

Create your own project and watch the video a second time, this time reproduce every step, at the end add your own function to the project and write a test.

 2. Follow this live coding [part 1](https://youtu.be/JF_t7P3UAso)[part 2](https://youtu.be/LbdeVTmHQgw). I show you a way to add test in your code for backend (server.js)

 3. With your project team identify a feature on server.js that you want to test. Checkout on a branch test, install mocha, isolate the feature in a module, write appropriate tests.

 Fail them first, and then write the code to succeed!
